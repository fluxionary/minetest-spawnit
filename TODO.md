before release:
* code quality:
  * prefix all "internal" but published function names with `_`
  * add settingtypes descriptions

* features
  * ability to specify that animals shouldn't spawn in a specific area

* the TOOOs in the files


FUTURE:
* need to be able to somehow say "spawn on leaves, but only if they're solid"
  * and/or/not/parentheses
* add way to toggle/filter spawns during runtime, based on groups or ???
* add way to specify that mobs shouldn't spawn in an area
* show exponential moving averages of some HUD stat values
