before release:
* code quality:
  * remove spawn_positions class?

* tuning
  * currently nothing known todo

* the TOOOs in the files


FUTURE:
* separate the active object area calculator into a separate mod so that others can use it.
* need to be able to somehow say "spawn on leaves, but only if they're solid"
  * and/or/not/parentheses
* add way to toggle/filter spawns during runtime, based on groups or ???
* show exponential moving averages of some HUD stat values
*
